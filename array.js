            Jesus and Satan had an argument over who could use the computer better. The argument went on for aeons and God, tired of the bickering decided that a test was to be carried out to determine who the ultimate computer guru was.\n
            Jesus and Satan were each given a computer to work with. They checked e-mails, worked with spreadsheet packages, used word processors and did some art.\n 
            The electricity flickered off and Satan screamed all the curse words he knew from the netherrealm. Jesus just sighed.\n
            Hours later, the electricity came back on and Jesus then began printing His work, Satan just stared at his screen and yelled 'Darn it, my work is lost'. Then looking at Jesus' screen, he said 'God, your favorite Son cheated. His job's still there.'
            God shrugged and replied 'Jesus saves'.
